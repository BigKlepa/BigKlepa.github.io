								Nurse VR was a student project where we got the assignment from our client, PedaXR. We were taught how to measure and administer a drug to a patient,
								and were then tasked to make an educational game about the process.
								</p>
								<p>
									
								</p>
								 In addition to core development, we paid attention to project management, with regularly scheduled meetings, weekly tasks and sprints.
								 At the conclusion, we handed the project over to our client, PedaXR, who are still demoing it today.

								I wrote the code for the teleportation system, whiteboard, the IV-drip, and many of the object interactions between medical equipment. 
								I also made a system that tracks the amount and type of liquid inside each container, so the game would support multiple different types of drug mixtures in the future.
