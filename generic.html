								Paikalla was our entry into the product development course, during my first year at Turku AMK, in 2019. We created an application for students and teachers to keep track of class attendance. 
								Teachers could create a lecture event with a password, and students were able to sign up to the events, with their mobile devices. 
								At the time, lecturers were using a pen and paper to check attendance. Our team won the competition. </p>
								<p>We developed the application with Android Studio. I primarily worked on designing the software architecture, designed and implemented the database into the application 
									 This was my first time using the services, but I managed to do my part, and learned a lot during the process.</p>
								<p> Technologies used: Google Firebase, Java, Android Studio</p> </p>
